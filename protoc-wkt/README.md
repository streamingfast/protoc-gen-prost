# Protoc Well-Known Types

This module includes serialized file descriptor sets for the Google Protobuf
well-known types. These descriptor sets can be used for supporting reflection
endpoints in Tonic gRPC servers.

This crate is versioned independently, but with metadata reporting the Google
`protoc` version that the descriptor sets were generated against.
